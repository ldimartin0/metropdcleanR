# metropdcleanR
This is an R package to help data analysts, data journalists, and anyone else import and clean **Metropolitan Police Department's** (the police department for the Washington D.C. metropolitan area) **stop data**.

Metropolitan PD only released their data after a number of lawsuits filed by ACLU-DC, Black Lives Matter DC, and Stop Police Terror Project D.C.. Read local coverage of those lawsuits [here](https://wjla.com/news/local/aclu-dc-lawsuit-mpd-stop-and-frisk-data-2020).

The data are available on MPD's website [here](https://mpdc.dc.gov/stopdata).

Coincidentally, Metropolitan PD's data releases are highly, highly messy. This package helps users import the data they want and clean it.
